        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs yolks and whites separated</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, 
                baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In another bowl, add egg yolks, ricotta, milk, vinegar, 
                vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Whisk until 
                fully incorporated and you start to see some bubbles. 
                Set aside.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together your egg whites just 
                until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Into the bowl with dry ingredients, add your wet ingredients 
                and your fluffed egg whites. Completely mix together with a 
                rubber spatula or whisk, making sure not to overwork the batter. 
                Only mix until combined - no more dry flour. Your batter should 
                look lumpy. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes to 
                thicken more.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat for a few minutes, just 
                until hot. Reduce the heat slightly before starting to cook the 
                pancakes. When you add butter or oil to the pan, if it starts 
                to brown, that means the pan is too hot and 
                should let it cool.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Once the pan is at the right heat, spray with oil or coat in 
                butter and drop about 1/3 cup of batter. You could add more or 
                less depending on what size you want them to be. Give it about 
                3 to 4 minutes on the first side. Bubbles should start to form 
                on the top. That's when it's ready to flip. Let both sides 
                turn slightly golden before taking off the pan. Continue this 
                process until batter is out!</li>
                <br>
            <li>Serve warm with maple syrup, powdered sugar, blueberries, 
                butter, or even blueberry jam.</li>
        </ol>
